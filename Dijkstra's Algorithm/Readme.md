# Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm - Easy Notes

## Step-by-Step Process

## MD ARAFAT KOYES

Start at the source node (v1) and set its distance to 0.
For all directly connected nodes, update their distances from v1.
Pick the next closest node (v2) (the one with the smallest cost).
Check all neighbors of v2:
Calculate total cost from v1 to these nodes.
Update the cost if a shorter path is found.
Repeat Steps 3-4 until all nodes are processed.
The final distances give the shortest path from v1 to all nodes.

## Tricks to Remember
Always pick the node with the smallest cost first.
Update distances only if a shorter path is found.
Keep repeating until all nodes are done.

## Quick Summary for Exam Notes
- Start at v1 (distance = 0).
- Update directly connected nodes.
- Pick the next closest node (v2).
- Update neighbor distances if a shorter path is found.
- Repeat until all nodes are processed.
- The final table gives the shortest paths.
